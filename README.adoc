== Quickstart

*Install*
```
npm install @eventicle/eventiclejs
```

*Configure*

index.ts
```
import {setEventSourceName,
  eventClientOnDatastore,
  InMemoryDatastore,
  setDataStore,
  setEventClient} from '@eventicle/eventiclejs';

// the "source" of the events created by this application
setEventSourceName('my-cool-service');

// in service data storage abstraction. Used by the internals of eventicle, can also be used in app code
setDataStore(new InMemoryDatastore());

// The connection to the event transport, this is in memory and stores events and state in the current datastore
setEventClient(eventClientOnDatastore());

```

Now that you have the basic Eventicle infrastructure running, you can start to emit and observe events using the event client.

```



```

* emit an event
* observe an event

* Manage state with an event sourced Aggregate Root
* Use a command to change state and emit events
* Use a View to create optimised representations of your data
* Make event driven workflows using a saga
